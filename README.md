If you're a football enthusiast and interested in discovering the top players in various skills like defense, tackling, attacking, dribbling, and goalkeeping, I highly recommend exploring this FIFA dataset analysis I've conducted. It's an excellent project for identifying the current best players in each of these abilities for your team.

# About the dataset.

As a scout hired by Real Madrid, I am tasked with finding the most talented football (soccer) players for the team. To accomplish this, I have access to a dataset containing information from the FIFA 19 video game. The dataset consists of 18,207 records, each containing 89 attributes. It provides details about players such as their short and long names, positions played, overall and potential ratings, value and weekly wage in euros, age, height, weight, nationality, and club affiliation.

The dataset covers a wide range of player attributes, including physical traits like acceleration, sprint speed, height, and weight, as well as skill-based characteristics like dribbling, shooting, defending, and goalkeeping abilities. Furthermore, it includes information about each player's contract status, release clause, and international reputation.

With this extensive dataset at my disposal, I can analyze and identify the best possible players to meet Real Madrid's requirements and strengthen the team.

1. The earnings of players are directly related to their reputation, which means that players with a higher reputation earn more. However, it appears that players with a score of 5 are earning less than those with a score of 4. Let's examine the potential reasons for this.

2. The majority of high-paid players fall within the age range of 25 to 35. This may suggest that as players age, their performance decreases, and extremely young players are still in the learning process. However, players aged between 25 and 35 are both young and experienced, making them highly sought after and commanding a high salary.

3. Gianluigi Donnarumma is the most well-rounded player, with exceptional reflexes, handling, diving, and ranking fourth in goal-kicking. He is undoubtedly the best option available. However, if we are unable to acquire him, we have another promising player in M. Maignan, who ranks in the top three in all areas except for speed. Therefore, either of these two players would be suitable, with a preference for Gianluigi Donnarumma.

4. Since our goal is to hire the best players in every position, it is reasonable to assume that we will be paying a considerable sum to these players. Based on the data, E. Halland is the best choice for an attacking finisher, although we have other options, they may be too expensive given the high salaries we will be paying to other top players.
